# ðŸ“‹ Der Town Implementation Plan

## Overview

This document outlines a phased approach to implementing the Der Town community events platform, transitioning from the existing Django/Wagtail implementation to a modern Astro + Supabase architecture as specified in `PROJECT_REQUIREMENTS.md`.

## ðŸŽ¯ Implementation Philosophy

### Pragmatic, Development-First Approach

This implementation follows a **pragmatic, development-first approach** that prioritizes:

1. **Rapid iteration** - Get working features quickly
2. **Essential QoL tools** - Automate repetitive development tasks
3. **DRY principles** - Build shared components as the codebase grows
4. **Real usage patterns** - Build sophisticated tools based on actual needs

### What to Build Early (Weeks 1-6)

**Essential Development Tools:**
- Basic Makefile commands (`make dev`, `make db-reset`, `make build`)
- Minimal Python utilities for database management
- Shared UI components and validation schemas
- TypeScript interfaces for type safety

**Why These Help Immediately:**
- Faster iteration cycles (reset DB in seconds)
- Consistent test data across team members
- Type safety to catch errors at compile time
- Reusable components reduce duplication

### What to Avoid Early

**Complex Infrastructure (Build Later):**
- Advanced duplicate detection (start with exact matches only)
- Comprehensive data validation (basic field validation is enough)
- Complex testing frameworks (manual testing is fine for MVP)
- Production monitoring (can add after launch)
- Advanced admin features (Supabase dashboard is sufficient)

**Why Avoid These Early:**
- Over-engineering solutions to problems you haven't encountered
- Slowing down development velocity
- Adding complexity without proportional benefit
- Building tools that may not be needed

### When to Add Sophisticated Tools

**Post-Launch (Based on Real Usage):**
- Fuzzy matching for duplicates (when you see actual duplicate patterns)
- Advanced data validation (when you encounter data quality issues)
- Automated ingestion pipelines (when you have real data sources)
- Comprehensive monitoring (when you need production insights)

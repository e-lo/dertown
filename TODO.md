## 🛠️ Technical Implementation Details

### Key Architectural Decisions

1. **Static-First Approach**: Use Astro's static site generation for optimal performance
2. **Hybrid Rendering**: Server-side rendering for dynamic content, static generation for static content
3. **API-First Design**: All data access through RESTful API endpoints
4. **Component-Based UI**: Reusable components using Shoelace and custom components
5. **Progressive Enhancement**: Core functionality works without JavaScript

### Database Schema Migration

The existing Django models will be translated to Supabase tables:

- `events` → `events` (with updated column names)
- `locations` → `locations`
- `organizations` → `organizations`
- `tags` → `tags`
- `community_announcements` → `announcements`
- `source_sites`

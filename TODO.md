# üìã Der Town Implementation Plan

---

## ‚úÖ Completed or No Longer Necessary

- **Fix API Routes & Server Configuration**: Astro is now configured for SSR. All API routes and dynamic pages are server-rendered and up-to-date with the database. For local dev, use SSR without the Netlify adapter; for production, use the Netlify adapter and deploy to Netlify.
- **Shoelace Carousel**: Replaced with Glider.js for static-first, minimal-JS carousel.
- **Event Carousel Card**: Now uses plain HTML and Tailwind CSS, no Shoelace dependency.
- **Main Event Carousel**: Fully implemented and visually polished.
- **Event Submission Page**: Created `/submit` page with EventForm component.
- **Basic Makefile, Python utilities, and database scripts**: Implemented and documented.
- **Public Submission Form**: Implemented, but needs fuzzy matching and spam protection.
- **Announcement Marquee**: Implemented and styled.
- **Responsive Layout**: Implemented for all major pages/components.
- **Event List and Filtering**: Implemented on `/events` page.
- **Event Detail Pages**: Implemented with calendar export and sharing.
- **Calendar UI**: FullCalendar.js integrated and filterable.
- **Social Sharing (Event Detail Page)**: Implemented with Web Share API and clipboard fallback.
- **RSS/iCal/Google Calendar Feeds**: API endpoints exist but don't work due to server configuration issues. Static redirect pages created but need server-side API routes to function.
- **Category-Specific RSS & iCal Feeds**: Only global feeds are implemented. Need to add endpoints and UI for category-specific feeds.
- **Honeypot/CAPTCHA**: Not yet implemented on the submission form.
- **Analytics**: Google Analytics implemented with tag ID G-T9Z4DYJ75S

## üü° In Progress / Needs Attention
- **Technical Debt**: Error handling, loading states, SEO, structured data, and tests are still needed.

## üü° Future Phases to Consider

- **Homepage Per-Category Carousels**: Not yet implemented. Only a single main carousel is present. Need to add a loop over categories and render a carousel for each, with appropriate filtering.
- **Admin Interface Polish**: Supabase dashboard is primary; custom UI is WIP
- **Fuzzy Matching for Organizations/Locations in Submission Form**

---

## ‚ùå Items No Longer Needed or Changed Approach

- **Shoelace Web Components**: No longer used for carousels or cards.
- **Complex Admin UI**: Only build if Supabase dashboard is insufficient.
- **Advanced Duplicate Detection**: Not needed for MVP; keep exact match only for now.
- **Comprehensive Testing Framework**: Manual testing is sufficient for MVP; add tests post-launch.

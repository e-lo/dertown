# üõ†Ô∏è Developing Der Town

## ü§ñ AI Agent & Single Contributor Workflow

- This project is maintained by a single contributor with AI agent assistance.
- For code review, refactoring, and new features, describe your goal and let the AI agent propose a plan and edits.
- Use the AI to keep code quality, documentation, and tests up to date.
- Document all major changes in commit messages and TODO.md.
- If you step away for a while, review this file and README.md to get back up to speed quickly.

## üóÇÔ∏è Local Development & Environment

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+
- Python 3.10+
- Git
- Supabase CLI

### Setup

1. Clone the repo: `git clone ... && cd dertown`
2. Install Node.js deps: `npm install`
3. Install Python deps: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
4. Copy env: `cp .env.example .env` and fill in secrets
5. Start Supabase: `supabase start` (or use hosted project)
6. Reset/seed DB: `make db-reset && make db-seed`
7. Start dev server: `npm run dev`

### Environment Variables

- See `.env.example` for required variables (Supabase, Auth, API keys, etc.)

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Makefile & Python Utilities

- `make dev` ‚Äî Start dev server
- `make lint` ‚Äî Lint code
- `make format` ‚Äî Format code
- `make db-reset` ‚Äî Reset DB
- `make db-seed` ‚Äî Seed DB
- Python scripts in `scripts/` for DB management, CSV/ICS import, validation

## üö¶ Initial Project Setup & First Deployment

### 1. Supabase Project Setup

- Create a new project at [Supabase](https://app.supabase.com/)
- Go to Project Settings > API and copy your `SUPABASE_URL` and `SUPABASE_KEY`
- In the SQL editor, run all migrations in `supabase/migrations/` (or use `supabase db push` locally)
- (Optional) Seed the database:
  - Use `make db-seed` or run the Python scripts in `scripts/` for test data
- (Optional) Set up storage buckets if needed (see `supabase/config.toml`)

### 2. Netlify Site Setup

- Create a new site at [Netlify](https://app.netlify.com/)
- Connect your GitHub repo (choose the `dev` or `main` branch)
- In Site settings > Environment variables, add:
  - `SUPABASE_URL` (from Supabase API settings)
  - `SUPABASE_KEY` (from Supabase API settings)
  - (Optional) `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` for admin/server-side scripts
  - (Optional) `GOOGLE_ANALYTICS_ID` for analytics
- Set build command: `npm run build`
- Set publish directory: `dist`
- Deploy the site

### 3. First-Time Setup Tips

- Ensure your `.env` file matches `.env.example` for local dev
- If migrations fail, check DB version compatibility in `supabase/config.toml`
- For troubleshooting, check Netlify deploy logs and Supabase project logs
- After first deploy, test public and admin flows (login, event/announcement submission, admin approval)

---

## üöÄ Deployment

- Deploy to Netlify
- In the Netlify dashboard, go to your site > Site settings > Environment variables
- Add the following variables (copy/paste from the Supabase connection widget):
  - `SUPABASE_URL`
  - `SUPABASE_KEY`
- (Optional, for admin/server-side scripts) Add `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` if needed
- For analytics, add `GOOGLE_ANALYTICS_ID` if using Google Analytics
- Deploy as usual (Netlify will use these variables for both build and runtime)

---

## üóÉÔ∏è Database Management

- **Migrations:** Add SQL files to `supabase/migrations/` and run `supabase db push`
- **Seeding:** `make db-seed` or use Python scripts
- **Validation:** Use provided scripts to validate/clean data before import
- **Manual Import:** Use `scripts/dev_utils.py` for CSV/ICS import
- **Backup:** Use Supabase dashboard or CLI for backups; test recovery monthly

---

## üõ°Ô∏è Admin & Manual Procedures

- **Review/approve events & announcements:** Use `/admin` panel (Supabase Auth required)
- **Handle pending locations/organizations:** Approve via admin panel; not public until approved
- **Manual data import:** Use Python scripts in `scripts/` for CSV/ICS
- **Calendar Sync:**
  - All calendar platforms (iCal, Google, Outlook) use feed-based subscriptions (`/api/calendar/ical`)
  - Feeds are always up-to-date; calendar apps poll every 2-6 hours
  - Tag-based feeds supported via query params (e.g., `/api/calendar/ical?tag=Arts+Culture`)
  - See PROJECT_REQUIREMENTS.md for technical details
- **Initial data seed:**
  - Run `make db-initial-seed` to upload all reference and content data (tags, organizations, locations, events, announcements) from `/seed_data` to your database.
  - **Warning:** Only run this on a fresh database! It will insert all data, including events and announcements.

## üß© UI Component System

- Hybrid system: custom Astro components + Tailwind utilities
- Core UI: `Badge.astro`, `Button.astro`, `Input.astro`, `Select.astro`, `FormField.astro`
- Utilities: `date-utils.ts`, `components.css`
- No full UI library (e.g., daisyUI) to avoid bloat/conflicts
- See PROJECT_REQUIREMENTS.md for rationale

---

## üß™ Testing & Code Quality

- `npm run lint` ‚Äî Lint code
- `npm run format` ‚Äî Format code
- `npm run test` ‚Äî Run tests (if present)
- Manual testing: Use dev server and admin panel to verify all flows

---

## üîí Security & Monitoring

- RLS policies enforced in Supabase
- Private fields (emails, comments) only visible to admins
- Public APIs use field-level security via DB views
- Spam protection: honeypot fields and rate limiting on forms
- Monitor error rates and performance via analytics

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Troubleshooting & Maintenance

- If you encounter issues, check logs, Supabase status, and environment variables
- Use AI agent for troubleshooting and best practices
- Regularly backup DB and test recovery
- Review and update dependencies monthly

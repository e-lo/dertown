# UI Component System Recommendations

## Executive Summary

After analyzing your codebase, I recommend a **hybrid component system** that combines custom Astro components with enhanced Tailwind utilities. This approach provides the benefits of componentization without the overhead of a full UI library.

## Current State Analysis

### Repetitive Patterns Found

1. **Badges/Tags**: "Today", "Featured Event", category tags repeated across components
2. **Form Elements**: Long Tailwind classes for inputs, selects, buttons
3. **Date/Time Formatting**: Repeated logic in multiple components
4. **Button Styles**: Similar button patterns with long class strings
5. **Filter Components**: Search inputs and dropdowns with repetitive styling

### Why Not daisyUI?

While daisyUI would reduce class repetition, it would:

- Add another dependency and potential conflicts
- Require learning daisyUI's component system
- May not align with your existing design system
- Add bundle size for components you might not use
- Conflict with your existing Tailwind configuration

## Recommended Approach: Hybrid Component System

### Phase 1: Core UI Components âœ… (Implemented)

**Components Created:**

- `Badge.astro` - For tags, status indicators, labels
- `Button.astro` - For all interactive buttons
- `Input.astro` - For form inputs
- `Select.astro` - For dropdown selections
- `FormField.astro` - For labeled form fields

**Utilities Created:**

- `date-utils.ts` - Centralized date/time formatting
- `components.css` - Tailwind utility classes

### Alternative Approaches

- **Headless UI**: For complex interactive components
- **Radix UI**: For advanced accessibility needs
- **Custom Web Components**: For framework-agnostic components
